# Assembly Instructions

These instructions assume that you have already [acquired and 3D printed all of the parts](../#sourcing-parts).

## Hardware

The motors and idlers ship with various screws, nuts, and bushings.  They are tiny and can be challenging to differentiate.  Take a few minutes to sort them into bins/cups/bowls using the image below as a reference.

**Tip: use tweezers to handle the screws.**

## Step 1
Add the FPX330-S01 frame to the first XL330.

(TODO: Replace this with a proper export.  This is a screen grab from the YouTube video.  Also, I think those are the wrong size screws.)

Gather the parts:

![Step 1 Parts](./img/step1-parts.png)
* XL330-M077-T (1x)
* FPX330-S101 Frame (1x)
* ![Dark Blue](./img/square-dark-blue.png) M2x4 TAP screws (4x)

Attach the frame to the servo horn (the rotating disc).
